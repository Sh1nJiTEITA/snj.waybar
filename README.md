# Installation
Configuration files must be cloned to `~/.config/waybar`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sh1nJiTEITA/snj.waybar.git ~/.config/waybar
```


# Caution
`waybar` must be build with cava module to make configuration work as expected. For `Arch Linux` it can be reached by using `aur` repositories:
```bash
yay -S waybar-cava
```
It will work until you need some other module with same behaviour like `mpris` module.
